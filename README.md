This repository contains my solutions to the Problem set 2019 for the module Programming and Scripting at GMIT
[See the instructions here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/blob/master/problems.pdf)

## How to  download this repository
1. Go to my GitHub profile 
2.Click the download zip button at this page (https://github.com/vukasm/Problem-set-2019-Programming-and-Scripting-)

## How to run the code
1. Make sure you have Python installed

## What each file contains
1. question-i.py contains my solution to the question 1 of the problem set; the program that calculates the sum of all numbers between 1 and n by using while loop.
2. question-ii.py contains my solution to the question 2 of the problem set; Program that tells you wheather or not today is a day that starts with the letter T. It shows my knowledge of if/elif/else statements.
3. question-iii.py contains my solution to the question 3 of the problem set; Program that prints all numbers between 1000 and 10000 devisable by 6 but not 12 by using 'range' function.
4. question-iv.py contains my solution to the question 4 of the problem set; proving the Collatz conjecture.
5. question-v.py contains my solution to the question 5 of the problem set; I created a program that tells you whether or not n is a prime number by using different loops in python.
6. question-vi.py contains my solution to the question 6 of the problem set; I am showing my knowledge of using strings in python by creating a Program that asks the user to input a string and outputs every other word.
7. question-vii.py contains my solution to the question 7 of the problem set; Program that takes a positive floating number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root by using math module.
8. question-viii.py contains my solution to the question 8 of the problem set; shows my understanding of date and time module by creating a Program that outputs today's date in a format "Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15 pm".
9. question-ix.py contains my solution to the question 9 of the problem set; proving my understanding of opening files for reading and writing files through this program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line.
10. question-x.py contains my solution to the question 10 of the problem set; Program that displays a plot of the functions x, x^2 and 2^x in the range [0,4]. Here I am using numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.
10.Annabel-lee.txt contains a poem written my Edgar Allan Poe called Annabel Lee, which I was using as a text file for question 9.
